const BROWSER_ACTION_DESCRIPTION = `Request to interact with a Puppeteer-controlled browser. Every action, except close, will be responded to with a screenshot of the browser's current state, along with any new console logs. You may only perform one browser action per message, and wait for the user's response including a screenshot and logs to determine the next action.

Browser Session Lifecycle:
- Browser sessions start with launch and end with close
- The session remains active across multiple messages and tool uses
- You can use other tools while the browser session is active - it will stay open in the background`

const ACTION_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Browser action to perform`

const URL_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `URL to open when performing the launch action; must include protocol`

const COORDINATE_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Screen coordinate for hover or click actions in format 'x,y@WIDTHxHEIGHT' where x,y is the target position on the screenshot image and WIDTHxHEIGHT is the exact pixel dimensions of the screenshot image (not the browser viewport). Example: '450,203@900x600' means click at (450,203) on a 900x600 screenshot. The coordinates will be automatically scaled to match the actual viewport dimensions.`

const SIZE_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Viewport dimensions for the resize action in format 'WIDTHxHEIGHT' or 'WIDTH,HEIGHT'. Example: '1280x800' or '1280,800'`

const TEXT_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `Text to type when performing the type action, or key name to press when performing the press action (e.g., 'Enter', 'Tab', 'Escape')`
